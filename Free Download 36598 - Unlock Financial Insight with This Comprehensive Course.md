## Diving Deeper: Understanding Potential Interpretations of 365/98

To further clarify the potential significance of the 365/98 ratio, let's explore some possible interpretations:

*   **Day Sales Outstanding (DSO) Variant:** As mentioned, it could represent a variant of DSO. Standard DSO calculation is Accounts Receivable / (Revenue/365). The 365/98 formula suggests we are comparing 365 days to a value representing something like 98% of the revenue amount. For example, we can consider 98 as representing a very specific metric of revenue that is more tightly related to the current Accounts Receivables.

*   **Inventory Turnover:** Another possibility is that the 98 represents the cost of goods sold (COGS). In this case, the ratio is part of an inventory turnover calculation. 365/98 might give the rate and number of days inventory has turnover.

*   **Other Business-Specific Ratios:** Depending on the industry and business model, the 98 could represent any number of other relevant metrics, such as customer acquisition cost, marketing spend, or production costs. The free course will provide a framework for analyzing the specific context and determining the most appropriate interpretation.
