## Understanding Fraction Simplification: Why It Matters

Fraction simplification, also known as reducing fractions, is the process of expressing a fraction in its simplest form. This means finding an equivalent fraction where the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1. This skill is essential because:

*   **Clarity:** Simplified fractions are easier to understand and work with.
*   **Accuracy:** It reduces the chances of errors in calculations.
*   **Efficiency:** It saves time and effort in more complex mathematical problems.
*   **Foundation:** It builds a solid foundation for understanding ratios, proportions, and algebra.

## Breaking Down 90/72: A Step-by-Step Guide

Let's illustrate how to simplify the fraction 90/72. This involves finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 90 and 72 and then dividing both the numerator and the denominator by this GCD.

1.  **Finding the Factors:**

    *   Factors of 90: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 30, 45, 90
    *   Factors of 72: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72

2.  **Identifying the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):** The greatest number that divides both 90 and 72 without leaving a remainder is 18.

3.  **Dividing by the GCD:**

    *   Divide the numerator (90) by the GCD (18): 90 ÷ 18 = 5
    *   Divide the denominator (72) by the GCD (18): 72 ÷ 18 = 4

Therefore, 90/72 simplified is 5/4. This is an improper fraction, which can also be represented as a mixed number: 1 1/4.
