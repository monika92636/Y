## Understanding the 365/98 Ratio: A Foundation for Financial Analysis

The "365/98" concept, while not a standard standalone term, hints at the calculation of a crucial financial metric related to the **cash conversion cycle (CCC)**.  It specifically points towards calculating the **accounts payable payment period**, which is a vital component in assessing a company’s efficiency in managing its working capital.  Essentially, it helps determine how quickly a company pays its suppliers. This free financial modeling course breaks down each component and shows you how to use it.

## Why is the Accounts Payable Payment Period Important?

*   **Liquidity Assessment:** A longer payment period suggests the company effectively manages its cash flow, delaying payments to suppliers.
*   **Negotiating Power:** A company that consistently pays later may have stronger negotiating power with its suppliers.
*   **Industry Benchmarking:** Comparing the payment period to industry averages reveals if a company's financial performance is in line with its peers.
*   **Working Capital Management:** Optimizing the payment period is a key aspect of efficient working capital management.
