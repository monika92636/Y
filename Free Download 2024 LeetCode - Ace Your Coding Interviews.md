## What This Free 2024 LeetCode Course Includes

This free course is designed to provide a robust foundation in data structures and algorithms, specifically tailored for LeetCode success in 2024. Here's a breakdown of the core modules:

**Module 1: Foundations – Data Structures Refresher**

*   **Arrays and Strings:**  Essential operations, common patterns (two-pointer technique, sliding window), and LeetCode practice problems covering array manipulation, string reversal, and palindrome detection. This section stresses **time and space complexity analysis**, a critical skill for LeetCode success.
*   **Linked Lists:**  Understanding different types of linked lists (singly, doubly, circular), common operations (insertion, deletion, reversal), and LeetCode problems involving linked list manipulation, cycle detection, and merging sorted lists. The focus here is on **pointer manipulation** and understanding the nuances of linked list memory management.
*   **Stacks and Queues:**  Implementation and applications of stacks and queues, LeetCode problems related to expression evaluation, bracket balancing, and implementing queue using stacks. The importance of **LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) and FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principles** is emphasized.
*   **Hash Tables:**  Understanding hash functions, collision resolution techniques, and LeetCode problems involving hash table implementation and usage for tasks like finding duplicates, counting frequencies, and implementing caching mechanisms.  We cover the **trade-offs between different hash table implementations** in terms of performance and memory usage.

**Module 2: Core Algorithms – Problem-Solving Strategies**

*   **Recursion and Backtracking:** Mastering recursive thinking, understanding backtracking algorithms, and applying them to LeetCode problems like permutations, combinations, and solving Sudoku puzzles. This section focuses on **identifying the base case and recursive step**, and understanding the call stack.
*   **Sorting Algorithms:**  In-depth analysis of various sorting algorithms (bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort), their time and space complexities, and LeetCode problems requiring efficient sorting solutions. We’ll analyze **the best-case, average-case, and worst-case scenarios** for each algorithm.
*   **Searching Algorithms:**  Linear search vs. binary search, applications of binary search in LeetCode problems involving sorted arrays, and understanding the importance of logarithmic time complexity. We will also cover **interpolation search and exponential search** for specialized cases.
*   **Dynamic Programming:**  Understanding the principles of dynamic programming (overlapping subproblems, optimal substructure), applying it to LeetCode problems involving Fibonacci sequence, knapsack problem, and longest common subsequence. We’ll cover both **top-down (memoization) and bottom-up (tabulation) approaches** to dynamic programming.

**Module 3: Advanced Topics – Level Up Your Skills**

*   **Trees and Graphs:**  Understanding different types of trees (binary tree, binary search tree, AVL tree), graph representations (adjacency list, adjacency matrix), and graph traversal algorithms (BFS, DFS). LeetCode problems involving tree traversal, graph connectivity, and shortest path algorithms. Special attention is given to **tree balancing and graph cycle detection**.
*   **Greedy Algorithms:**  Understanding the greedy approach to problem-solving and applying it to LeetCode problems involving activity selection, fractional knapsack, and Huffman coding. This section focuses on **proving the optimality of the greedy choice**.
*   **Bit Manipulation:**  Understanding bitwise operators and their applications in LeetCode problems involving counting set bits, finding missing numbers, and determining if a number is a power of two.  We'll also delve into **Gray codes and Karnaugh maps**.
*   **System Design (Introduction):**  A brief overview of system design principles, common architectural patterns, and how to approach system design questions in technical interviews. Although not strictly LeetCode, this module provides **valuable context for real-world problem solving**.

**Module 4: LeetCode Problem-Solving Strategies & Mock Interviews**

*   **Pattern Recognition:**  Identifying common problem patterns in LeetCode questions and applying appropriate data structures and algorithms.
*   **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**  Accurately analyzing the time and space complexity of your solutions.
*   **Code Optimization:**  Techniques for optimizing your code to improve performance.
*   **Mock Interviews:**  Simulated coding interviews to practice your problem-solving skills and communication techniques. This includes **behavioral questions related to coding experience**.
